        "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\n",
        "mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\n",
        "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n",
        "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n",
        "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n",
        "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n",
        "the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n",
        "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\n",
        "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\n",
        "drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n",
        "reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n",
        "adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n",
        "throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n",
        "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n",
        "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n",
        "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\n",
        "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n",
        "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
        "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n",
        "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n",
        "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\n",
        "soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\n",
        "books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\n",
        "the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
        "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n",
        "and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n",
        "observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n",
        "mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
        "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n",
        "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\n",
        "of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n",
        "finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n",
        "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n",
        "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
        "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\n",
        "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n",
        "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n",
        "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n",
        "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n",
        "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n",
        "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
        "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n",
        "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n",
        "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n",
        "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n",
        "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
        "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n",
        "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
        "\n",
        "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
        "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
        "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
        "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n",
        "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\n",
        "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Seven!” I answered.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
        "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n",
        "that you intended to go into harness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, how do you know?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
        "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n",
        "servant girl?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
        "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
        "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
        "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
        "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n",
        "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n",
        "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n",
        "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
        "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n",
        "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n",
        "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n",
        "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
        "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n",
        "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n",
        "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n",
        "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n",
        "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
        "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
        "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n",
        "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n",
        "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
        "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
        "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
        "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
        "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Frequently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How often?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, some hundreds of times.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then how many are there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How many? I don’t know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
        "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
        "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n",
        "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n",
        "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n",
        "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n",
        "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\n",
        "said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\n",
        "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n",
        "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
        "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
        "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
        "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
        "wear a mask.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n",
        "means?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
        "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
        "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
        "it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
        "written.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
        "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n",
        "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
        "stiff.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n",
        "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\n",
        "with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n",
        "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n",
        "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
        "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
        "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
        "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\n",
        "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
        "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\n",
        "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n",
        "from his cigarette.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
        "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\n",
        "all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\n",
        "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
        "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\n",
        "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\n",
        "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\n",
        "doubts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\n",
        "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
        "whistled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n",
        "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
        "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\n",
        "is nothing else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\n",
        "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But your client—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
        "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\n",
        "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\n",
        "authoritative tap.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\n",
        "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\n",
        "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\n",
        "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
        "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\n",
        "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\n",
        "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\n",
        "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\n",
        "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\n",
        "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\n",
        "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
        "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
        "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\n",
        "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
        "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\n",
        "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\n",
        "of obstinacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
        "marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\n",
        "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\n",
        "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\n",
        "have I the honour to address?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",
        "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\n",
        "discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\n",
        "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\n",
        "alone.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\n",
        "my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\n",
        "gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\n",
        "“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\n",
        "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\n",
        "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\n",
        "European history.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I promise,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\n",
        "person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\n",
        "confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\n",
        "not exactly my own.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\n",
        "be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\n",
        "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\n",
        "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\n",
        "kings of Bohemia.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\n",
        "his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\n",
        "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\n",
        "most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\n",
        "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\n",
        "should be better able to advise you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\n",
        "uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\n",
        "the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\n",
        "he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\n",
        "was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\n",
        "Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\n",
        "Bohemia.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\n",
        "more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\n",
        "understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\n",
        "person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\n",
        "an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\n",
        "from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\n",
        "visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\n",
        "Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\n",
        "opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\n",
        "all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\n",
        "name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\n",
        "information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\n",
        "that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\n",
        "monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n",
        "\n",

        "Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\n",

        "made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\n",
        "quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\n",
        "mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\n",

        "friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\n",
        "times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\n",
        "vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\n",
        "tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\n",
        "pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\n",
        "heartily for some minutes.\n",
        "\n",

        "character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\n",
        "freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\n",
        "that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\n",
        "villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\n",
        "the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\n",
        "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\n",
        "and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\n",
        "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\n",
        "could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\n",

        "daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\n",
        "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\n",
        "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\n",
        "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\n",
        "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\n",
        "never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\n",
        "Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\n",
        "confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\n",
        "and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\n",
        "began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\n",
        "over my plan of campaign.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\n",
        "He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\n",

        "his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\n",
        "transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\n",
        "likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\n",
        "continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\n",
        "gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\n",
        "widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\n",

        "I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\n",
        "to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\n",

        "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\n",
        "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\n",

        "\n",
        "“Where, indeed?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n",
        "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
        "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\n",
        "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\n",
        "she does not carry it about with her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\n",
        "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\n",
        "to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\n",
        "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\n",
        "indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\n",
        "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\n",
        "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\n",
        "in her own house.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But it has twice been burgled.”\n",
        "\n",

        "As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\n",
        "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\n",
        "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\n",
        "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\n",
        "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\n",
        "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\n",
        "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\n",
        "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\n",
        "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\n",
        "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\n",
        "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\n",
        "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\n",
        "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\n",
        "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\n",
        "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\n",
        "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\n",
        "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\n",
        "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\n",
        "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\n",
        "the hall, looking back into the street.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is dead,” cried several voices.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\n",
        "before you can get him to hospital.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\n",
        "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\n",
        "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\n",
        "This way, please!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\n",
        "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\n",
        "the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\n",
        "so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\n",
        "whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\n",
        "was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\n",
        "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\n",
        "was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\n",
        "the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\n",
        "to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\n",
        "my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\n",
        "thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\n",
        "injuring another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\n",
        "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\n",
        "the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\n",
        "rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\n",
        "of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\n",
        "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\n",
        "“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\n",
        "open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\n",
        "the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\n",
        "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\n",
        "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\n",
        "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\n",
        "and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\n",
        "quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\n",

        "\n",

        "“I am still in the dark.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\n",
        "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\n",
        "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I guessed as much.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\n",
        "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\n",
        "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That also I could fathom.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\n",
        "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\n",
        "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\n",
        "see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\n",
        "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How did that help you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\n",
        "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\n",
        "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\n",
        "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\n",
        "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\n",
        "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\n",
        "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\n",
        "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\n",
        "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\n",
        "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\n",
        "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\n",
        "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\n",
        "she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n",
        "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\n",
        "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\n",
        "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\n",
        "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\n",
        "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now?” I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\n",
        "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\n",
        "into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\n",
        "when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\n",
        "a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And when will you call?”\n",
        "\n",

        "peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\n",

        "brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\n",

        "mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\n",
        "which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\n",
        "difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\n",

        "“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg\n",
        "that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up in\n",
        "his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\n",
        "there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\n",
        "like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\n",
        "he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\n",
        "sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\n",
        "mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\n",

        "we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\n",
        "of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\n",
        "Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\n",

        "We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\n",
        "took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\n",
        "had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\n",
        "place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\n",
        "into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\n",
        "clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\n",
        "and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with\n",
        "“JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\n",
        "place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock\n",
        "Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\n",
        "all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he\n",
        "walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\n",
        "looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,\n",
        "and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\n",
        "three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly\n",
        "opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\n",
        "step in.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes as we walked away. “He is, in my\n",
        "judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\n",
        "sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\n",

        "\n",
        "The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\n",
        "the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\n",
        "the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\n",
        "arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\n",
        "The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\n",
        "a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\n",
        "the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we\n",
        "looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\n",
        "they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\n",
        "square which we had just quitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\n",
        "the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\n",
        "It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\n",
        "Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\n",
        "branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\n",
        "McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\n",
        "other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had\n",
        "some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\n",
        "where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\n",
        "red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\n",

        "My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\n",
        "capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\n",

        "gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\n",
        "gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\n",
        "of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\n",
        "ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\n",
        "singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\n",
        "extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\n",
        "the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\n",
        "occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\n",
        "extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\n",
        "so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\n",
        "his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\n",
        "Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\n",
        "and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\n",
        "intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\n",
        "look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\n",
        "mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\n",
        "James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\n",
        "he had set himself to hunt down.\n",

        "oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\n",
        "Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\n",
        "seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\n",
        "only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\n",
        "whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my\n",
        "house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\n",
        "of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to\n",
        "Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\n",
        "me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\n",
        "Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\n",
        "that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a\n",
        "man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\n",
        "up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\n",
        "explanation.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\n",
        "across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\n",
        "hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\n",
        "the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in\n",
        "animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\n",
        "Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\n",
        "sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\n",
        "frock-coat.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha! Our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\n",
        "and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think you\n",
        "know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\n",

        "\n",
        "“We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,” said Jones in his\n",
        "consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\n",
        "chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\n",
        "observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the\n",
        "police agent loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he\n",
        "won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\n",
        "but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say\n",
        "that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\n",
        "Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\n",
        "force.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with\n",

        "rubber.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for\n",
        "a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\n",
        "will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\n",
        "some £ 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\n",
        "wish to lay your hands.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,\n",
        "Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\n",
        "rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\n",
        "remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\n",
        "and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\n",
        "his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\n",
        "know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\n",
        "week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\n",
        "I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve\n",
        "had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\n",
        "you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\n",
        "and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\n",
        "Watson and I will follow in the second.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\n",
        "lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\n",
        "afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\n",
        "until we emerged into Farrington Street.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\n",
        "is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\n",
        "it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\n",
        "an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\n",
        "is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\n",
        "claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\n",
        "ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\n",
        "guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\n",
        "through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small\n",
        "corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\n",
        "opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\n",
        "at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\n",
        "lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\n",
        "so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\n",
        "piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked as he held up\n",
        "the lantern and gazed about him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\n",
        "flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\n",
        "remarked, looking up in surprise.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\n",
        "severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\n",
        "expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\n",
        "upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\n",
        "injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\n",
        "the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\n",
        "minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to\n",
        "satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\n",
        "pocket.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly\n",
        "take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\n",
        "will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\n",
        "time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no\n",
        "doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\n",
        "principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\n",
        "and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\n",
        "criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\n",
        "at present.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\n",
        "warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your French gold?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\n",
        "borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It\n",
        "has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\n",
        "and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit\n",
        "contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\n",
        "reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\n",
        "single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\n",
        "subject.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\n",
        "that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\n",
        "will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\n",
        "screen over that dark lantern.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And sit in the dark?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\n",
        "thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\n",
        "after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\n",
        "that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\n",
        "choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\n",
        "them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\n",
        "I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\n",
        "those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\n",
        "fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\n",
        "which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\n",
        "and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never\n",
        "before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\n",
        "the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To\n",
        "me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\n",
        "something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\n",
        "dank air of the vault.\n",
        "\n",
        "“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through\n",
        "the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\n",
        "asked you, Jones?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\n",
        "wait.”\n",
        "\n",
        "What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\n",
        "hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\n",
        "almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\n",
        "stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\n",
        "to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\n",
        "could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\n",
        "distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\n",
        "thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\n",
        "over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\n",
        "the glint of a light.\n",
        "\n",
        "At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\n",
        "lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\n",
        "warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\n",
        "almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\n",
        "of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\n",
        "protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\n",

        "marked a chink between the stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\n",
        "sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\n",
        "left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\n",
        "lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\n",
        "looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\n",
        "aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\n",
        "rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\n",
        "hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\n",
        "himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags?\n",
        "Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\n",
        "The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\n",
        "as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\n",
        "revolver, but Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\n",
        "the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes blandly. “You have no chance at\n",
        "all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So I see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that\n",
        "my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\n",
        "compliment you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\n",
        "effective.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at\n",
        "climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\n",
        "prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not be\n",
        "aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\n",
        "when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\n",
        "\n",
        "“All right,” said Jones with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you\n",
        "please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\n",
        "Highness to the police-station?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is better,” said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\n",
        "the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Really, Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from\n",
        "the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\n",
        "There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\n",
        "complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\n",
        "that have ever come within my experience.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John\n",
        "Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\n",
        "matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\n",
        "amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\n",
        "and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see, Watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\n",
        "sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, “it was perfectly\n",
        "obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\n",
        "fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\n",
        "of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\n",
        "out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of\n",
        "managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\n",
        "The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the\n",
        "colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must\n",
        "draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They\n",
        "put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\n",
        "rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\n",
        "secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I\n",
        "heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\n",
        "that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\n",
        "vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s\n",
        "business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\n",
        "could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\n",
        "as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\n",
        "could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and\n",
        "his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end\n",
        "of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\n",
        "assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\n",
        "daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\n",
        "cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\n",
        "could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\n",
        "running a tunnel to some other building.\n",
        "\n",
        "“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\n",
        "surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\n",
        "ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It\n",
        "was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\n",
        "answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\n",
        "upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were\n",
        "what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\n",
        "wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\n",
        "burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\n",
        "walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\n",
        "friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\n",
        "drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the\n",
        "chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\n",
        "asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\n",
        "cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that\n",
        "they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should\n",
        "use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\n",
        "removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\n",
        "would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\n",
        "expected them to come to-night.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\n",

        "\n",
        "“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel\n",
        "it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\n",
        "from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\n",
        "so.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\n",
        "\n",
        "He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\n",

        "fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than\n",
        "anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to\n",
        "conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If\n",
        "we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\n",
        "city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\n",
        "are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\n",
        "cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\n",
        "generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all\n",
        "fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\n",
        "and unprofitable.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come\n",
        "to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\n",
        "We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\n",
        "yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\n",
        "artistic.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\n",
        "realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police\n",

        "magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\n",
        "vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so\n",
        "unnatural as the commonplace.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so,”\n",
        "I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\n",
        "to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\n",
        "you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\n",
        "here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a\n",
        "practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A\n",
        "husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I\n",
        "know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There\n",
        "is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\n",
        "bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\n",

        "\n",

        "Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\n",
        "up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a\n",
        "teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\n",
        "that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\n",
        "out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\n",
        "allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\n",
        "average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge\n",
        "that I have scored over you in your example.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\n",
        "centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\n",
        "ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\n",

        "problems.”\n",
        "\n",

        "“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\n",
        "They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\n",
        "I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\n",
        "field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\n",
        "effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\n",
        "apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\n",
        "rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\n",
        "matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\n",
        "which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\n",

        "He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\n",
        "gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over\n",
        "his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\n",
        "woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\n",
        "feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\n",
        "of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she\n",
        "peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\n",
        "body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\n",
        "glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\n",
        "the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\n",
        "the bell.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\n",
        "cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\n",
        "_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\n",
        "matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\n",
        "discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\n",
        "longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\n",
        "may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\n",
        "much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\n",
        "resolve our doubts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\n",
        "to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\n",
        "his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\n",
        "pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\n",
        "which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\n",
        "an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\n",
        "fashion which was peculiar to him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little\n",

        "\n",
        "“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are\n",
        "without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\n",
        "words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\n",
        "astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You’ve heard about\n",

        "\n",

        "for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not\n",
        "rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\n",
        "little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\n",
        "Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made\n",
        "me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my\n",
        "father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go\n",
        "to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\n",
        "there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\n",
        "and came right away to you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\n",
        "different.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\n",

        "“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\n",
        "when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\n",
        "nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\n",
        "Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\n",
        "mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\n",
        "came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\n",
        "traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\n",
        "which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been\n",
        "alive.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\n",

        "the greatest concentration of attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\n",
        "Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand\n",
        "five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large\n",
        "a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\n",
        "doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that\n",
        "a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\n",
        "that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\n",
        "so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\n",
        "course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\n",
        "every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\n",
        "pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a\n",

        "to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\n",
        "out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\n",
        "France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\n",

        "\n",
        "“Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t\n",
        "have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\n",
        "should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\n",
        "mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\n",
        "mine yet.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\n",
        "and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\n",
        "he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\n",

        "the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\n",
        "typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said\n",

        "things that he would think of.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of\n",

        "\n",
        "“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the\n",

        "conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\n",
        "gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\n",
        "told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\n",
        "whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\n",
        "plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\n",
        "glasses against the glare.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\n",
        "marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me\n",
        "swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\n",
        "always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\n",
        "and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\n",
        "from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they\n",
        "talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\n",
        "they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\n",
        "afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\n",
        "didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\n",
        "his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want\n",
        "to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\n",
        "company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\n",
        "very morning of the wedding.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\n",
        "Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s\n",
        "Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\n",
        "Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\n",
        "put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\n",
        "happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\n",
        "first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\n",
        "out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\n",
        "looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\n",
        "imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\n",
        "eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\n",

        "\n",
        "“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\n",

        "and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I\n",
        "was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would\n",
        "claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\n",
        "wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\n",
        "have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n",

        "\n",
        "“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\n",
        "that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could\n",
        "anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\n",
        "me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\n",
        "my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\n",
        "very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\n",
        "mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\n",
        "Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at\n",
        "night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\n",
        "sob heavily into it.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I\n",

        "of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\n",
        "further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\n",

        "and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\n",
        "it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\n",
        "spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her\n",
        "more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\n",
        "a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\n",
        "Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\n",
        "year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\n",
        "were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\n",
        "me,” I remarked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\n",
        "and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\n",
        "realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\n",
        "or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\n",
        "gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\n",
        "feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\n",
        "upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was\n",
        "brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\n",
        "the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\n",
        "the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,\n",
        "hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\n",
        "a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\n",
        "really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\n",
        "everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\n",
        "have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my\n",
        "boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always\n",
        "at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\n",
        "knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\n",
        "sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double\n",
        "line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\n",
        "the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand\n",
        "type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\n",
        "of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\n",
        "broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\n",
        "the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\n",
        "upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It surprised me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested\n",
        "on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\n",
        "wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\n",
        "having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was\n",
        "buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\n",
        "the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,\n",
        "otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\n",
        "half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\n",
        "hurry.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\n",
        "friend’s incisive reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\n",
        "but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\n",
        "torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\n",
        "and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and\n",
        "dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark\n",
        "would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though\n",
        "rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you\n",
        "mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on\n",
        "the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About\n",
        "five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\n",
        "hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\n",
        "moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,\n",
        "when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\n",
        "gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\n",

        "glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in\n",
        "them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\n",
        "remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\n",

        "“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat\n",
        "little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\n",
        "superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\n",
        "point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\n",
        "conclusive.”\n",

        "the young lady’s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could\n",
        "meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that\n",
        "we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can\n",

        "little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\n",
        "reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\n",
        "have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\n",
        "he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\n",
        "fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\n",
        "Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\n",
        "the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\n",
        "circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\n",
        "be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\n",
        "\n",
        "I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\n",
        "conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\n",

        "free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\n",
        "half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of\n",

        "asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\n",
        "armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\n",

        "on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\n",
        "connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\n",

        "obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",

        "his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\n",
        "to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\n",
        "he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\n",

        "that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\n",
        "of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\n",
        "hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\n",
        "fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\n",
        "upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\n",
        "blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\n",
        "very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\n",
        "was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\n",
        "these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\n",
        "of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he\n",
        "was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\n",
        "referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the\n",
        "case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\n",
        "circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes\n",
        "thoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\n",
        "you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\n",
        "an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It\n",
        "must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\n",
        "against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\n",
        "culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\n",
        "among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\n",
        "believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may\n",
        "recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case\n",
        "in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\n",
        "to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\n",
        "westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\n",
        "breakfasts at home.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will\n",
        "find little credit to be gained out of this case.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\n",
        "laughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\n",
        "which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\n",
        "too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\n",
        "confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\n",
        "employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\n",
        "I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\n",
        "right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\n",
        "noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\n",

        "characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\n",
        "shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\n",
        "as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\n",
        "slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\n",
        "that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine\n",
        "a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\n",
        "satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of\n",
        "observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just\n",
        "possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\n",

        "him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\n",
        "hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\n",
        "his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\n",
        "have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can\n",
        "at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\n",
        "not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\n",
        "were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\n",
        "arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\n",
        "highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\n",
        "under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\n",
        "a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\n",
        "either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\n",
        "and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\n",
        "unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\n",
        "father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\n",
        "forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\n",
        "according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\n",
        "his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\n",
        "are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\n",
        "mind rather than of a guilty one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”\n",

        "the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\n",
        "I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\n",

        "rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\n",
        "was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\n",
        "Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\n",
        "is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\n",
        "game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\n",
        "thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\n",
        "front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\n",
        "“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\n",
        "hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be\n",
        "much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\n",
        "doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\n",
        "to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that\n",
        "his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\n",
        "Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\n",
        "heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I\n",
        "found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\n",
        "injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\n",
        "instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\n",
        "my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\n",
        "ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\n",
        "have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\n",
        "being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\n",

        "\n",
        "“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\n",
        "disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\n",

        "brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\n",
        "of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\n",

        "I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\n",
        "streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay\n",

        "were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\n",
        "unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the\n",
        "time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\n",
        "his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and\n",
        "deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\n",
        "something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the\n",
        "weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\n",
        "In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\n",
        "the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\n",
        "shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon\n",
        "my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\n",
        "That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\n",
        "quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\n",
        "for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\n",
        "blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to\n",
        "it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could\n",
        "that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow\n",
        "does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an\n",
        "attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I\n",
        "cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the\n",
        "incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true\n",
        "the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\n",
        "overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\n",
        "to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back\n",
        "turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\n",
        "improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s\n",
        "opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I\n",

        "\n",
        "“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\n",
        "insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\n",
        "lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\n",
        "a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\n",

        "Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\n",
        "his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\n",
        "him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\n",
        "that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\n",
        "not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\n",
        "come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\n",
        "that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\n",
        "over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\n",
        "already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\n",

        "\n",
        "“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\n",
        "One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\n",
        "pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\n",
        "away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the\n",
        "murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had\n",
        "returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And\n",
        "now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\n",
        "leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”\n",
        "\n",
        "There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\n",
        "and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the\n",
        "carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said\n",
        "that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\n",
        "abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\n",
        "has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,\n",
        "and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\n",
        "gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\n",
        "here speaks of his kindness to him.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\n",
        "McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\n",
        "under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son\n",
        "to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\n",
        "that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\n",
        "proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\n",
        "know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\n",
        "as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,\n",
        "winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\n",
        "flying away after theories and fancies.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are right,” said Holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to\n",
        "tackle the facts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\n",
        "get hold of,” replied Lestrade with some warmth.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And that is—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\n",
        "theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.\n",
        "“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\n",
        "left.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, that is it.” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\n",
        "two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\n",
        "the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\n",
        "gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\n",
        "heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’\n",
        "request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\n",
        "death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had\n",
        "then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\n",
        "different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\n",
        "which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\n",
        "this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\n",
        "Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and\n",
        "darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\n",
        "eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\n",
        "bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\n",
        "stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\n",
        "to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\n",
        "absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\n",
        "remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\n",
        "quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\n",
        "along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\n",
        "woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\n",
        "district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\n",
        "amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes\n",
        "would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\n",
        "detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\n",
        "indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\n",
        "interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\n",
        "was directed towards a definite end.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\n",
        "fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\n",
        "Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\n",
        "which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\n",
        "pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On\n",
        "the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\n",
        "a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\n",
        "the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\n",
        "exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\n",
        "the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\n",
        "the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\n",
        "face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\n",
        "trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\n",
        "then turned upon my companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\n",
        "other trace. But how on earth—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
        "twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\n",
        "vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\n",
        "been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\n",
        "it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\n",
        "covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are\n",
        "three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens and lay\n",
        "down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\n",
        "rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice\n",
        "he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\n",
        "marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran\n",
        "when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet\n",
        "as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the\n",
        "gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?\n",
        "Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
        "they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they\n",
        "come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\n",
        "track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\n",
        "shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes\n",
        "traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\n",
        "his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained\n",
        "there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\n",
        "seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\n",
        "not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\n",
        "reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\n",
        "carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the\n",
        "wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning\n",
        "to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the right must\n",
        "be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\n",
        "perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",
        "luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\n",
        "Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up\n",
        "in the wood.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The\n",
        "murder was done with it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see no marks.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There are none.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How do you know, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\n",
        "There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\n",
        "with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And the murderer?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\n",
        "thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\n",
        "a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are\n",
        "several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\n",
        "search.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.\n",

        "British jury.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes calmly. “You work your own method,\n",
        "and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\n",
        "probably return to London by the evening train.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\n",
        "populous neighbourhood.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said, “and\n",
        "I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\n",

        "laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“All right,” said Holmes quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here\n",

        "\n",
        "Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\n",

        "perplexing position.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Look here, Watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down\n",

        "his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing\n",
        "him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\n",
        "several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s\n",

        "quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\n",
        "in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to\n",
        "make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\n",
        "though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\n",
        "she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\n",
        "as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and\n",

        "streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear\n",
        "should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\n",
        "bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\n",

        "memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that\n",
        "foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\n",
        "have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\n",
        "my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\n",
        "than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\n",
        "he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\n",
        "but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\n",

        "round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very\n",
        "often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great\n",

        "in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\n",
        "begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in\n",

        "without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\n",
        "the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation\n",
        "grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the\n",
        "usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.\n",
        "He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of\n",
        "society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door\n",
        "locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of\n",
        "drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\n",

        "no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\n",

        "who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\n",
        "roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\n",

        "\n",
        "“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\n",
        "your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\n",
        "sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\n",
        "search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\n",
        "at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\n",
        "water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\n",
        "known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew\n",
        "how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\n",
        "myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\n",
        "however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\n",
        "some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\n",

        "found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\n",
        "the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\n",
        "K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’\n",
        "written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\n",
        "which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\n",
        "nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered\n",
        "papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of\n",

        "of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\n",
        "for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\n",
        "from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\n",
        "absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at\n",
        "once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\n",
        "in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.\n",
        "I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\n",
        "consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\n",
        "the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\n",
        "unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death\n",
        "from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected\n",
        "with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\n",
        "idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\n",

        "\n",
        "“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I\n",

        "\n",
        "“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years\n",

        "happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\n",
        "away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\n",

        "destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\n",

        "remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\n",
        "bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up\n",
        "to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier\n",
        "could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a\n",
        "single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in\n",
        "a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other\n",
        "ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which\n",
        "the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\n",
        "which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of\n",

        "necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts\n",
        "which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you\n",
        "will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these\n",
        "days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare\n",
        "accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\n",
        "possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\n",
        "and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,\n",

        "the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in\n",

        "shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see\n",
        "what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a\n",
        "strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason\n",
        "for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\n",
        "habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\n",
        "lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude\n",
        "in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\n",
        "something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\n",
        "someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he\n",
        "feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\n",
        "which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the\n",
        "postmarks of those letters?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\n",
        "from London.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the\n",
        "probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a\n",
        "ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\n",
        "Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\n",
        "in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\n",
        "anything?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“A greater distance to travel.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then I do not see the point.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or\n",
        "men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their\n",
        "singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\n",
        "You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\n",
        "Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have\n",
        "arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven\n",
        "weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\n",
        "difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the\n",
        "sailing vessel which brought the writer.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is possible.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\n",
        "this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\n",
        "always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\n",
        "travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\n",
        "cannot count upon delay.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good God!” I cried. “What can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\n",
        "the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\n",
        "clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\n",
        "have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s\n",
        "jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\n",
        "of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\n",
        "holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\n",

        "“‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\n",
        "sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was\n",
        "formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the\n",
        "Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of\n",
        "the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,\n",
        "and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for\n",
        "the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from\n",
        "the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were\n",
        "usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\n",
        "but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,\n",
        "melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim\n",
        "might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the\n",
        "country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\n",
        "him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was\n",
        "the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that\n",
        "there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving\n",
        "it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to\n",
        "the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\n",
        "of the efforts of the United States government and of the better\n",
        "classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,\n",
        "the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been\n",
        "sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the\n",
        "sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\n",
        "of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\n",
        "and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\n",
        "more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\n",
        "register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\n",

        "pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then\n",
        "there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,\n",
        "and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\n",
        "Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,\n",
        "and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime\n",

        "over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.\n",

        "to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round\n",

        "box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\n",
        "upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\n",
        "that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\n",
        "was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\n",

        "of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\n",
        "Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\n",
        "started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s\n",
        "office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking\n",

        "walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did\n",
        "not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was\n",
        "walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\n",
        "ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\n",
        "at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\n",
        "window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\n",
        "describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to\n",
        "her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\n",
        "her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\n",
        "behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\n",
        "although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\n",
        "had on neither collar nor necktie.\n",

        "found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to\n",
        "ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\n",
        "stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\n",
        "who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\n",
        "pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\n",
        "and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\n",
        "Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\n",
        "way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\n",
        "in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\n",
        "way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\n",
        "sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\n",
        "to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\n",
        "made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\n",
        "else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was\n",
        "their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\n",
        "believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\n",
        "sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\n",
        "from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy\n",
        "which he had promised to bring home.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\n",
        "made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were\n",
        "carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The\n",
        "front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\n",
        "bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between\n",
        "the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\n",
        "tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\n",
        "water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On\n",
        "examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\n",
        "several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\n",
        "bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\n",
        "clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His\n",
        "boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no\n",
        "signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\n",
        "traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently\n",
        "have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\n",
        "bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\n",

        "of the tragedy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\n",
        "the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\n",
        "but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the\n",
        "foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance\n",
        "at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\n",
        "crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\n",
        "he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\n",
        "that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\n",
        "gentleman’s clothes.\n",

        "human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh\n",
        "Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who\n",
        "goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to\n",
        "avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\n",
        "vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the\n",
        "left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in\n",
        "the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\n",
        "cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\n",
        "piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\n",
        "leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\n",
        "fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional\n",
        "acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\n",
        "reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\n",
        "no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\n",
        "pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\n",
        "turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair\n",
        "of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\n",
        "colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\n",
        "mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\n",
        "to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.\n",
        "This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium\n",

        "“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\n",

        "and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could\n",
        "be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who\n",
        "had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\n",
        "premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\n",
        "matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\n",
        "he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\n",
        "with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\n",
        "was seized and searched, without anything being found which could\n",
        "incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\n",
        "right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\n",
        "cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\n",
        "adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\n",
        "stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\n",
        "source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair\n",
        "and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\n",
        "mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion that\n",
        "she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\n",
        "must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\n",
        "protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\n",
        "the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\n",
        "clue.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\n",
        "feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.\n",
        "Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\n",

        "\n",

        "“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\n",
        "and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\n",
        "that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\n",
        "different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\n",
        "house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\n",
        "the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\n",
        "Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\n",

        "“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\n",
        "this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\n",
        "is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\n",
        "It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\n",
        "tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\n",
        "throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\n",
        "sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\n",
        "the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\n",
        "from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\n",
        "There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,\n",
        "where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\n",
        "the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\n",
        "of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\n",
        "with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\n",

        "it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\n",
        "him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\n",
        "appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\n",
        "stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what\n",

        "there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\n",

        "a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\n",

        "wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions\n",
        "from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of\n",
        "Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\n",
        "ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In\n",

        "dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\n",
        "to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\n",
        "pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\n",
        "room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\n",
        "of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\n",

        "“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\n",
        "sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself as\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his\n",
        "boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\n",
        "one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\n",
        "here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\n",

        "my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\n",
        "bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the\n",
        "half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away\n",
        "we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\n",
        "bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\n",
        "either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the\n",
        "horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\n",
        "but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\n",
        "their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\n",
        "Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\n",
        "dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found\n",
        "ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,\n",
        "and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\n",
        "horse’s head while the other led us in.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the\n",
        "stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to\n",
        "have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\n",
        "and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\n",
        "desk.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with\n",
        "being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So I heard. You have him here?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“In the cells.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is he quiet?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Dirty?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\n",
        "as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\n",
        "will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\n",
        "agree with me that he needed it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I should like to see him very much.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your\n",
        "bag.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,\n",
        "opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\n",
        "whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He\n",
        "quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\n",
        "through.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\n",
        "towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\n",
        "a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\n",
        "coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He\n",
        "was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\n",
        "covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad\n",
        "wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\n",
        "contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\n",
        "teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red\n",
        "hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he\n",
        "might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened\n",
        "the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\n",
        "large bath-sponge.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\n",
        "quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look a\n",
        "credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into the\n",
        "lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\n",
        "turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\n",
        "stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\n",
        "twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\n",
        "in the county of Kent.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off\n",
        "under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\n",
        "tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\n",
        "the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\n",
        "twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\n",
        "bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\n",
        "smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\n",
        "bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\n",
        "scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.\n",
        "I know him from the photograph.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\n",
        "to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray what am I charged with?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged\n",
        "with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,” said the\n",
        "inspector with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the\n",
        "force, but this really takes the cake.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\n",
        "been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.\n",
        "“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was not the wife; it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God\n",
        "help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\n",
        "exposure! What can I do?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\n",
        "on the shoulder.\n",
        "\n",
        "“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,\n",
        "“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\n",
        "convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\n",
        "you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\n",
        "find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\n",
        "make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the\n",
        "proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“God bless you!” cried the prisoner passionately. “I would have endured\n",
        "imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable\n",
        "secret as a family blot to my children.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a\n",
        "schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.\n",
        "I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\n",
        "reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to\n",
        "have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\n",
        "volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my\n",
        "adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\n",
        "could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I\n",
        "had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\n",
        "famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\n",
        "attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\n",
        "possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\n",
        "the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head\n",
        "of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\n",
        "part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\n",
        "For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the\n",
        "evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.\n",
        "4_d_.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\n",
        "time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\n",
        "for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden\n",
        "idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked\n",
        "for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\n",
        "City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the\n",
        "debt.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\n",
        "at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\n",
        "smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\n",
        "sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\n",
        "the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\n",
        "in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\n",
        "face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.\n",
        "He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\n",
        "Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\n",
        "evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This\n",
        "fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\n",
        "that my secret was safe in his possession.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\n",
        "I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700\n",
        "a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\n",
        "advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\n",
        "repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\n",
        "character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\n",
        "poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\n",

        "pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\n",

        "carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\n",
        "corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\n",

        "having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\n",
        "uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\n",
        "vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\n",
        "Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\n",
        "Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\n",

        "hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\n",
        "was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes\n",
        "had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was\n",
        "pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\n",
        "the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\n",

        "which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\n",
        "strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is\n",
        "of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\n",
        "well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\n",
        "evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\n",
        "to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\n",
        "fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\n",
        "work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\n",

        "\n",

        "goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has\n",
        "grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which\n",
        "he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are\n",

        "improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\n",
        "forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question of\n",

        "\n",
        "“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\n",

        "ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\n",
        "so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\n",
        "has assuredly gone down in the world.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\n",
        "the moral retrogression?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting his\n",
        "finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\n",
        "never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\n",
        "certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\n",
        "precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\n",
        "elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has\n",
        "less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\n",
        "weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\n",
        "of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign\n",
        "that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n",

        "The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the\n",
        "scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a\n",

        "evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\n",
        "of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he\n",
        "might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\n",
        "remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\n",
        "away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\n",
        "bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\n",
        "which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep\n",
        "her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\n",
        "gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\n",
        "could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\n",
        "Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of\n",
        "dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\n",
        "where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\n",
        "Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\n",
        "struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\n",
        "terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\n",
        "against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the\n",
        "offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of\n",
        "intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion\n",
        "and was carried out of court.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\n",
        "aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence of\n",
        "events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\n",
        "goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little\n",
        "deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\n",
        "innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\n",
        "the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and\n",
        "all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we\n",
        "must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\n",
        "ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\n",
        "this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\n",
        "in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall\n",
        "have recourse to other methods.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What will you say?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the\n",
        "corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\n",
        "can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker\n",

        "“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\n",
        "the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in\n",
        "breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of\n",
        "nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the\n",
        "impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the\n",
        "introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\n",
        "knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run\n",
        "down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\n",
        "papers.”\n",

        "“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just\n",
        "buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must\n",
        "have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\n",
        "family is now devouring.”\n",
        "\n",
        "When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\n",
        "against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it\n",
        "glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\n",
        "Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and\n",
        "older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\n",
        "yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\n",
        "southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\n",
        "carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite\n",
        "of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\n",
        "murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\n",
        "about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\n",
        "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\n",
        "and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to\n",

        "\n",
        "“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\n",
        "innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\n",
        "of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\n",

        "\n",
        "I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six\n",
        "when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the\n",
        "house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\n",
        "buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\n",
        "was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,\n",

        "\n",
        "“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his armchair and\n",
        "greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\n",
        "readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\n",
        "cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\n",
        "summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\n",
        "time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\n",
        "intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A\n",
        "touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\n",
        "hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black\n",
        "frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,\n",
        "and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff\n",
        "or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with\n",
        "care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\n",
        "letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we\n",
        "expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\n",
        "a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been so\n",
        "plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt that\n",
        "the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\n",
        "bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at\n",
        "recovering them.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\n",

        "\n",
        "“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I\n",
        "presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\n",
        "same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally\n",
        "well?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, certainly, certainly,” answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\n",
        "own bird, so if you wish—”\n",
        "\n",
        "The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as\n",
        "relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see\n",
        "what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\n",
        "to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\n",
        "attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\n",
        "shoulders.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way,\n",
        "would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\n",
        "somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\n",
        "goose.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\n",
        "property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha\n",
        "Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the\n",
        "day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\n",
        "instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\n",
        "every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\n",
        "duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\n",
        "sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”\n",
        "With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\n",
        "strode off upon his way.\n",
        "\n",
        "“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes when he had closed the door\n",
        "behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\n",
        "the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not particularly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up\n",
        "this clue while it is still hot.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“By all means.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\n",
        "about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\n",
        "cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\n",
        "like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\n",
        "we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\n",
        "and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an\n",
        "hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small\n",
        "public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\n",
        "Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two\n",
        "glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said\n",
        "he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\n",
        "a member of your goose club.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed! Whose, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Breckinridge is his name.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and\n",
        "prosperity to your house. Good-night.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\n",
        "came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson that though we have so\n",
        "homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\n",
        "other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless\n",
        "we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\n",
        "confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\n",
        "which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\n",
        "placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\n",
        "the south, then, and quick march!”\n",
        "\n",
        "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\n",
        "of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\n",
        "name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\n",
        "with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\n",
        "the shutters.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\n",
        "slabs of marble.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That’s no good.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Who by?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The landlord of the Alpha.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\n",
        "\n",
        "To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\n",
        "salesman.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,\n",
        "“what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\n",
        "which you supplied to the Alpha.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should\n",
        "be so warm over such a trifle.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I\n",
        "pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\n",
        "business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the\n",
        "geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they\n",
        "were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\n",
        "them.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\n",
        "inquiries,” said Holmes carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is\n",
        "off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\n",
        "of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\n",
        "bred.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the\n",

        "\n",
        "“It’s nothing of the kind.”\n",
        "\n",

        "ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\n",

        "agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\n",
        "like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\n",
        "a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\n",

        "know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\n",
        "allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\n",
        "was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\n",
        "hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\n",
        "woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,\n",
        "wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\n",

        "few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\n",
        "As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved\n",
        "slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\n",

        "hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\n",
        "of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\n",
        "moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\n",
        "writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\n",
        "convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\n",
        "bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\n",
        "forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There\n",
        "was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\n",
        "her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a\n",
        "fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\n",
        "loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\n",
        "dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\n",
        "and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\n",
        "from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\n",

        "metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\n",

        "\n",
        "“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\n",
        "alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\n",
        "coroner come to?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct\n",
        "had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\n",
        "satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\n",
        "fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\n",
        "old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\n",
        "night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\n",
        "solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\n",
        "the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\n",
        "staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\n",
        "she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\n",

        "building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\n",
        "move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\n",
        "bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\n",
        "night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\n",

        "\n",
        "“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\n",

        "“Why, what do you mean?”\n",
        "\n",
        "For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\n",
        "hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the\n",
        "marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",

        "hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\n",

        "There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\n",
        "hands and stared into the crackling fire.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is a very deep business,” he said at last. “There are a thousand\n",
        "details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\n",
        "of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\n",
        "Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\n",
        "without the knowledge of your stepfather?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\n",
        "important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\n",
        "that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,\n",
        "but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“By no means.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\n",
        "town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there\n",
        "in time for your coming.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\n",
        "trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\n",
        "afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\n",
        "from the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,\n",
        "leaning back in his chair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\n",

        "fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\n",
        "interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion\n",
        "to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\n",
        "metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\n",
        "that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\n",
        "there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\n",

        "or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\n",
        "\n",
        "The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\n",
        "door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\n",
        "himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\n",
        "professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\n",
        "frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\n",
        "his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\n",
        "the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\n",
        "side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\n",
        "the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\n",
        "other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\n",
        "fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\n",
        "of prey.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion\n",
        "quietly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, Doctor,” said Holmes blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\n",
        "traced her. What has she been saying to you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man furiously.\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\n",
        "companion imperturbably.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\n",
        "forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I\n",
        "have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\n",
        "\n",
        "My friend smiled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Holmes, the busybody!”\n",
        "\n",
        "His smile broadened.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\n",
        "said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\n",
        "draught.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\n",
        "affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\n",
        "dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,\n",
        "seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n",
        "\n",
        "“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling\n",
        "the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not\n",
        "quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\n",
        "grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up\n",
        "the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\n",
        "detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\n",
        "however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\n",
        "her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\n",
        "shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’\n",
        "Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\n",
        "matter.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\n",
        "excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\n",
        "with notes and figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine its\n",
        "exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\n",
        "investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\n",
        "time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through\n",
        "the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can\n",
        "claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\n",
        "therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\n",
        "mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\n",
        "serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has\n",
        "proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\n",
        "of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\n",
        "dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\n",
        "ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\n",
        "drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\n",
        "revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument\n",
        "with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\n",
        "tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\n",
        "\n",
        "At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\n",
        "where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\n",
        "miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\n",
        "bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\n",
        "wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\n",
        "air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\n",
        "there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\n",
        "and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\n",
        "the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\n",
        "eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\n",
        "Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\n",
        "over the meadows.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Look there!” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\n",
        "a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\n",
        "the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Stoke Moran?” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\n",
        "driver.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we\n",
        "are going.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\n",
        "some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\n",
        "find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\n",
        "fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his\n",
        "eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\n",
        "Leatherhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile, “that this\n",
        "fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\n",
        "business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\n",
        "that we have been as good as our word.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\n",
        "which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she\n",
        "cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.\n",
        "Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\n",
        "before evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,” said\n",
        "Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\n",
        "Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“So it appears.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\n",
        "he say when he returns?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\n",
        "cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\n",
        "to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\n",
        "Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\n",
        "at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\n",
        "portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\n",
        "each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\n",
        "with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\n",
        "ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\n",
        "right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\n",
        "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\n",
        "this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\n",
        "against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\n",
        "there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\n",
        "walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\n",
        "attention the outsides of the windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\n",
        "centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to\n",
        "Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\n",
        "seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\n",
        "room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\n",
        "runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\n",
        "in it, of course?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\n",
        "from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\n",
        "and bar your shutters?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\n",
        "open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\n",
        "without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\n",
        "passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\n",
        "they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”\n",
        "said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly\n",
        "presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\n",
        "were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\n",
        "matter.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\n",
        "three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\n",
        "we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\n",
        "sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\n",
        "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\n",
        "the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\n",
        "one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\n",
        "dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\n",
        "with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\n",
        "room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\n",
        "and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\n",
        "and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\n",
        "the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\n",
        "while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\n",
        "every detail of the apartment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing to a\n",
        "thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\n",
        "lying upon the pillow.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It looks newer than the other things?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\n",
        "wanted for ourselves.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\n",
        "will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\n",
        "floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\n",
        "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\n",
        "between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\n",
        "the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\n",
        "some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\n",
        "Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Won’t it ring?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\n",
        "can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\n",
        "opening for the ventilator is.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or\n",
        "two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\n",
        "builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\n",
        "same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\n",
        "bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\n",
        "permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\n",
        "inner apartment.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his\n",
        "step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\n",
        "shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\n",
        "beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\n",
        "and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\n",
        "Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\n",
        "keenest interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My stepfather’s business papers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No. What a strange idea!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\n",
        "the top of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\n",
        "saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\n",
        "There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted down\n",
        "in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\n",
        "greatest attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\n",
        "lens in his pocket. “Hullo! Here is something interesting!”\n",
        "\n",
        "The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\n",
        "corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\n",
        "so as to make a loop of whipcord.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that, Watson?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and\n",
        "when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\n",
        "think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\n",
        "permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\n",
        "when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\n",
        "several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\n",
        "liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\n",
        "reverie.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should\n",

        "\n",
        "“I shall most certainly do so.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\n",
        "inn over there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, that is the Crown.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Certainly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\n",
        "when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the\n",
        "night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\n",
        "your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\n",
        "everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\n",
        "occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\n",

        "\n",
        "“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\n",

        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\n",
        "sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from\n",
        "our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\n",
        "inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\n",
        "Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\n",
        "of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\n",
        "the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s\n",
        "voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\n",
        "The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\n",
        "up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\n",
        "darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\n",

        "\n",

        "“It is very kind of you.”\n",
        "\n",

        "was visible to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\n",
        "you saw all that I did.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\n",
        "could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You saw the ventilator, too?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\n",
        "small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\n",
        "hardly pass through.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\n",

        "\n",
        "“My dear Holmes!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\n",
        "could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\n",
        "that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\n",
        "be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s\n",
        "inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But what harm can there be in that?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\n",
        "is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\n",
        "not that strike you?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\n",

        "\n",

        "relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call\n",
        "it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\n",
        "only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is\n",
        "the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\n",
        "Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\n",
        "even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\n",
        "deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\n",
        "over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\n",
        "for a few hours to something more cheerful.”\n",
        "\n",
        "About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\n",
        "was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\n",
        "away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\n",
        "light shone out right in front of us.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes\n",
        "from the middle window.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\n",
        "that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\n",
        "possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\n",
        "out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\n",
        "light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\n",
        "sombre errand.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\n",
        "breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we\n",
        "reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\n",
        "window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\n",
        "to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\n",
        "with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\n",
        "darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\n",
        "upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put\n",
        "his lips to my ear.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\n",
        "cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\n",
        "moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\n",
        "Holmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\n",
        "bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\n",
        "onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\n",
        "seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\n",
        "his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\n",
        "I could do to distinguish the words:\n",
        "\n",
        "“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I nodded to show that I had heard.\n",
        "\n",
        "“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I nodded again.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\n",
        "ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\n",
        "you in that chair.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\n",
        "beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\n",
        "Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\n",
        "not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\n",
        "open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\n",
        "tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\n",
        "light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\n",
        "very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\n",
        "was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\n",
        "parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\n",
        "seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\n",
        "still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\n",
        "of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\n",
        "strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\n",
        "had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\n",
        "all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\n",
        "hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\n",
        "audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\n",
        "steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\n",
        "Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\n",
        "his cane at the bell-pull.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\n",
        "low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\n",
        "made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\n",
        "so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\n",
        "filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\n",
        "up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\n",
        "night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\n",
        "up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\n",
        "mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\n",
        "village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\n",
        "sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\n",
        "gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\n",
        "away into the silence from which it rose.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What can it mean?” I gasped.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after\n",
        "all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\n",
        "Roylott’s room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\n",
        "Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\n",
        "he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\n",
        "pistol in my hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\n",
        "dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\n",
        "light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\n",
        "table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\n",
        "grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\n",
        "thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\n",
        "stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\n",
        "was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\n",
        "the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\n",
        "band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\n",
        "his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\n",
        "move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\n",
        "diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He\n",
        "has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\n",
        "recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\n",
        "digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\n",
        "can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\n",
        "police know what has happened.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\n",
        "throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\n",
        "perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\n",
        "which he closed upon it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\n",
        "Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\n",
        "already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\n",
        "to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\n",
        "care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\n",
        "inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\n",
        "indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\n",
        "to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\n",
        "back next day.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\n",
        "shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\n",
        "insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n",
        "‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\n",
        "appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\n",
        "her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\n",
        "can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\n",
        "when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\n",
        "occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\n",
        "My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\n",
        "this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\n",
        "discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\n",
        "floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\n",
        "a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\n",
        "The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\n",
        "with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\n",

        "the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\n",

        "that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\n",
        "to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\n",
        "jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\n",
        "where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\n",
        "out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and\n",
        "then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\n",
        "the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\n",
        "flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\n",
        "the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\n",
        "stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\n",
        "pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,\n",
        "as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\n",
        "failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The\n",
        "instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\n",

        "opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\n",
        "shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\n",
        "lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\n",
        "forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\n",
        "the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\n",
        "was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\n",
        "tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\n",
        "gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\n",
        "her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\n",
        "and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\n",
        "walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\n",
        "minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\n",
        "plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\n",
        "several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\n",
        "on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you\n",
        "waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\n",
        "German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\n",
        "others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\n",
        "hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\n",
        "shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\n",
        "silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\n",
        "passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\n",
        "uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\n",
        "what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And\n",
        "where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\n",
        "knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that\n",
        "matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\n",
        "radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was\n",
        "quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\n",
        "country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\n",
        "to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\n",
        "fifty-guinea fee.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\n",
        "stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\n",
        "standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\n",
        "yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\n",
        "could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\n",
        "chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\n",
        "silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\n",
        "eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\n",
        "behind her.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\n",
        "calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\n",
        "to do.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\n",
        "possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass\n",
        "through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and\n",
        "shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\n",
        "forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she\n",
        "whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\n",
        "in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\n",
        "fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\n",
        "which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\n",
        "I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\n",
        "payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\n",
        "monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\n",
        "shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\n",
        "declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\n",
        "her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\n",
        "footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw\n",
        "up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\n",
        "noiselessly as she had come.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\n",

        "\n",

        "that you have felt the draught.’\n",
        "\n",

        "corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\n",
        "the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\n",
        "crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above\n",
        "the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the\n",
        "damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put\n",
        "on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the\n",
        "warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\n",
        "eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\n",
        "man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least\n",
        "a fellow-countryman.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\n",
        "unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\n",
        "could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\n",
        "colonel ushered me in.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it\n",
        "would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn\n",
        "it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\n",
        "descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\n",
        "this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\n",
        "which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\n",
        "manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\n",
        "there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\n",
        "of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\n",
        "show us how we can set it right.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\n",
        "It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\n",
        "pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\n",
        "which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\n",
        "was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\n",
        "one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\n",
        "india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\n",
        "so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\n",
        "clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\n",
        "companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\n",
        "practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\n",
        "I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\n",
        "machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\n",
        "obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest\n",
        "fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\n",
        "engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\n",
        "wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\n",
        "to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\n",
        "had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\n",

        "\n",
        "“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\n",
        "speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\n",
        "eyes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took\n",
        "a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\n",
        "lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\n",
        "secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’\n",
        "I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\n",
        "into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\n",
        "leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\n",
        "upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\n",
        "light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\n",
        "jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\n",
        "within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\n",
        "screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\n",
        "implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\n",
        "levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\n",
        "head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\n",
        "Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\n",
        "very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the\n",
        "weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\n",
        "dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\n",
        "to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\n",
        "Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\n",
        "brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\n",
        "were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\n",
        "of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\n",
        "broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\n",
        "hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\n",
        "The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\n",

        "\n",
        "“‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\n",

        "time, but come!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\n",

        "latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\n",
        "the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\n",
        "the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My\n",
        "guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.\n",
        "Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\n",
        "of which the moon was shining brightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that\n",

        "“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\n",
        "passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\n",
        "forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s\n",
        "cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\n",
        "window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\n",
        "looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\n",
        "down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\n",
        "should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\n",
        "pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\n",
        "go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\n",
        "mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\n",
        "her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the\n",

        "He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\n",
        "his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\n",
        "the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\n",
        "loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\n",
        "rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\n",
        "that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\n",
        "ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my\n",
        "hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\n",
        "that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\n",
        "wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\n",
        "sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\n",
        "the rose-bushes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a\n",
        "very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\n",
        "breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\n",
        "and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The\n",
        "smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s\n",
        "adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\n",
        "yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to\n",
        "look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been\n",
        "lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little\n",
        "lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\n",
        "to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\n",
        "Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during\n",
        "those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\n",
        "There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was\n",
        "on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him\n",
        "whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\n",
        "strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\n",
        "me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\n",
        "one about three miles off.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\n",
        "wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\n",
        "was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\n",
        "dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\n",
        "put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\n",
        "extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\n",

        "cuttings.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It\n",
        "appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on\n",
        "the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic\n",
        "engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been\n",
        "heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\n",

        "fancy.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl\n",
        "said.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\n",
        "desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\n",
        "in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\n",
        "leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\n",
        "precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard\n",
        "at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\n",
        "bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\n",
        "Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\n",
        "a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\n",
        "of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\n",
        "a circle with Eyford for its centre.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten\n",
        "miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\n",
        "line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\n",
        "\n",

        "unconscious?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\n",
        "lifted and conveyed somewhere.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\n",
        "when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\n",
        "was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\n",
        "life.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have\n",

        "that we are in search of are to be found.”\n",

        "\n",
        "“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!\n",
        "Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\n",
        "country is more deserted there.”\n",

        "“And I say east,” said my patient.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several\n",
        "quiet little villages up there.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and\n",
        "our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity of\n",
        "opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\n",
        "casting vote to?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You are all wrong.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.” He placed his finger in the\n",
        "centre of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\n",

        "“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\n",
        "was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\n",
        "gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.\n",
        "“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and\n",
        "have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\n",
        "silver.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\n",

        "even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\n",
        "had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\n",
        "hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\n",
        "them right enough.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\n",
        "to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\n",
        "saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\n",
        "clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\n",
        "feather over the landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\n",
        "its way.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\n",
        "\n",
        "“When did it break out?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\n",
        "the whole place is in a blaze.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Whose house is it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Dr. Becher’s.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\n",
        "with a long, sharp nose?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\n",
        "Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\n",
        "waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\n",
        "understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\n",
        "Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\n",
        "hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and\n",
        "there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\n",
        "spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\n",
        "three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the\n",
        "gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\n",
        "window is the one that I jumped from.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\n",
        "There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\n",
        "crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\n",
        "they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\n",
        "Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\n",
        "though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\n",
        "word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\n",
        "German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\n",
        "a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\n",
        "rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\n",
        "fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to\n",
        "discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\n",
        "they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\n",
        "human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\n",
        "however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\n",
        "flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\n",
        "reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\n",
        "iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\n",
        "unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\n",
        "were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\n",
        "which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\n",
        "been already referred to.\n",
        "\n",
        "How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\n",
        "spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\n",
        "mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\n",
        "tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\n",
        "had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\n",
        "whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\n",
        "or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\n",
        "the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\n",
        "more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\n",
        "thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,\n",

        "has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\n",
        "character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\n",
        "pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\n",
        "the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\n",

        "to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\n",
        "of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\n",
        "and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\n",

        "to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\n",
        "brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\n",

        "mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in\n",
        "the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had\n",
        "ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\n",

        "my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\n",
        "footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\n",
        "palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\n",

        "the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\n",
        "it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\n",
        "turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\n",
        "gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have\n",

        "\n",

        "piece?’\n",
        "\n",

        "the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story and, with a\n",
        "scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the\n",
        "police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the\n",
        "inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\n",
        "sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\n",
        "charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\n",
        "matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\n",
        "national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\n",
        "everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would\n",

        "five minutes.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\n",

        "was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\n",
        "of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\n",
        "to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\n",
        "all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\n",
        "stones.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in\n",

        "beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\n",
        "away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words\n",
        "of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the\n",
        "inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only\n",
        "of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\n",
        "he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\n",
        "be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\n",
        "persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\n",
        "I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\n",
        "to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The\n",
        "police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\n",
        "it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already\n",
        "offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my\n",
        "honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\n",
        "\n",
        "He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\n",

        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\n",
        "silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\n",

        "himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\n",
        "such a theory tenable?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But what other is there?” cried the banker with a gesture of despair.\n",
        "“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you\n",
        "please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\n",
        "an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\n",
        "\n",
        "My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\n",
        "I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\n",
        "stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt\n",
        "of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\n",
        "unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I\n",
        "felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\n",
        "dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the\n",
        "whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\n",
        "breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\n",
        "Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\n",
        "hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\n",
        "desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\n",
        "journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\n",
        "of the great financier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\n",
        "little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\n",
        "stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\n",
        "entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\n",
        "a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\n",
        "kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a\n",
        "lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\n",
        "all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us\n",
        "standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\n",
        "front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind\n",
        "into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\n",
        "the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\n",
        "sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\n",
        "She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\n",
        "which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\n",
        "not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.\n",
        "Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\n",
        "As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\n",
        "sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\n",
        "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\n",
        "with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she\n",
        "went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\n",
        "sweet womanly caress.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\n",
        "dad?” she asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts\n",
        "are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\n",
        "having acted so harshly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\n",
        "him.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\n",
        "coronet in his hand?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my\n",
        "word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.\n",
        "It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your\n",
        "affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\n",
        "from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\n",
        "to inquire more deeply into it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n",
        "\n",
        "“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\n",
        "stable lane now.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to\n",
        "find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\n",
        "succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\n",
        "Arthur is innocent of this crime.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\n",
        "it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\n",
        "shoes. “I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\n",
        "Might I ask you a question or two?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\n",
        "I came down.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\n",
        "the windows?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Were they all fastened this morning?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\n",
        "your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\n",
        "have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\n",
        "and that the two may have planned the robbery.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker\n",
        "impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\n",
        "in his hands?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\n",
        "Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\n",
        "her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Do you know him?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His\n",
        "name is Francis Prosper.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,\n",
        "farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, he did.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\n",
        "\n",
        "Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black\n",
        "eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”\n",
        "She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’ thin, eager\n",
        "face.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I should be very glad now to go upstairs,” said he. “I shall probably\n",
        "wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\n",
        "take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\n",
        "large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\n",
        "opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\n",
        "powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go upstairs,” said he at last.\n",
        "\n",
        "The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\n",
        "a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\n",
        "bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the\n",
        "lumber-room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Have you it here?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is it on the dressing-table.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not\n",
        "wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\n",
        "look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\n",
        "upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,\n",
        "and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\n",
        "side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\n",
        "gems had been torn away.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds\n",
        "to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\n",
        "break it off.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\n",
        "result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am\n",
        "exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\n",
        "break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\n",
        "happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\n",
        "pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\n",
        "of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\n",
        "Holder?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\n",
        "during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\n",
        "succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\n",
        "shall now continue my investigations outside.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\n",
        "unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\n",
        "or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\n",
        "and his features as inscrutable as ever.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”\n",
        "said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\n",

        "“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I cannot tell.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.\n",
        "“And my son? You give me hopes?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“My opinion is in no way altered.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\n",
        "my house last night?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\n",
        "between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\n",
        "clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\n",
        "provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\n",
        "the sum I may draw.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\n",
        "Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\n",
        "before evening.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the\n",
        "case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\n",
        "dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\n",
        "to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\n",
        "topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three\n",
        "when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his\n",
        "chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\n",
        "With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\n",
        "his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above\n",
        "the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I\n",
        "fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\n",
        "be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I\n",
        "hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef from\n",
        "the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\n",
        "bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\n",
        "his expedition.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\n",
        "spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\n",
        "down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Where to?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\n",

        "\n",
        "“How are you getting on?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\n",
        "I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\n",
        "little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\n",
        "However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\n",
        "clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\n",
        "than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\n",
        "a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a\n",
        "few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\n",
        "he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\n",
        "\n",
        "I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\n",
        "retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\n",
        "days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\n",
        "lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\n",
        "but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\n",
        "cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\n",
        "as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he, “but you\n",
        "remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if\n",
        "that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\n",
        "which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\n",
        "and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\n",
        "to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\n",
        "which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\n",
        "and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\n",
        "him.\n",

        "night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\n",
        "might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\n",

        "trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\n",
        "far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\n",

        "back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\n",

        "whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I\n",

        "me.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\n",

        "at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\n",
        "son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\n",
        "as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\n",
        "was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and\n",
        "found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\n",
        "away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\n",
        "yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where\n",
        "the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\n",
        "where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\n",
        "mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\n",
        "of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the\n",
        "highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\n",
        "so there was an end to that clue.\n",
        "\n",
        "“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\n",
        "and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\n",
        "that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an\n",
        "instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\n",
        "beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\n",
        "had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\n",
        "had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\n",
        "with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\n",
        "causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\n",
        "returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\n",

        "was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that\n",

        "this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\n",
        "should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\n",
        "which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\n",
        "threatened.”\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\n",
        "the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\n",
        "only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\n",
        "find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\n",
        "shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance\n",
        "from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She\n",
        "had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said earnestly. “It is so\n",
        "very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\n",
        "advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\n",

        "“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\n",

        "though he little knew for what purpose.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin\n",

        "\n",
        "“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\n",
        "actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\n",
        "them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\n",

        "\n",
        "“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it\n",
        "occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in\n",
        "his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\n",
        "situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\n",
        "block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\n",
        "and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\n",
        "on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad,\n",
        "which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\n",
        "ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\n",
        "of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\n",
        "in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\n",
        "introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\n",
        "truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\n",
        "in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to\n",
        "be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more\n",
        "than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\n",
        "forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\n",
        "married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\n",
        "child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\n",
        "Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\n",
        "was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the\n",
        "daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\n",
        "her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\n",
        "feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a\n",
        "nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to\n",
        "her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered\n",
        "continually from one to the other, noting every little want and\n",
        "forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\n",
        "boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\n",
        "And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\n",
        "in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\n",
        "have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\n",
        "disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\n",
        "met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is\n",
        "small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\n",
        "His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage\n",
        "fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any\n",
        "creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\n",
        "he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,\n",
        "little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the\n",
        "creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to\n",
        "you to be relevant or not.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\n",
        "thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\n",
        "conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\n",
        "Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\n",
        "hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\n",
        "been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\n",
        "take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\n",
        "sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a\n",
        "most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\n",
        "nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\n",
        "the building.\n",
        "\n",
        "“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\n",
        "quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\n",
        "whispered something to her husband.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you,\n",
        "Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\n",
        "I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\n",
        "appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\n",
        "you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\n",
        "would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\n",
        "blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\n",
        "unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a\n",
        "better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\n",
        "expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\n",
        "in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\n",
        "is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\n",
        "with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\n",
        "placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\n",
        "this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\n",
        "the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\n",
        "stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\n",
        "was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\n",
        "has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\n",
        "her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\n",
        "hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\n",
        "the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\n",
        "little Edward in the nursery.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\n",
        "similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\n",
        "window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\n",
        "my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\n",
        "Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\n",
        "sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\n",
        "to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\n",
        "heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\n",
        "ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\n",
        "the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\n",
        "were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\n",
        "window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\n",
        "on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\n",
        "devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\n",
        "seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\n",
        "the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\n",
        "up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\n",
        "there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\n",
        "nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\n",
        "however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\n",
        "Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\n",
        "my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\n",
        "people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\n",
        "bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\n",
        "handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\n",
        "me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\n",
        "that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\n",
        "was behind me. She rose at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\n",
        "there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No, I know no one in these parts.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\n",
        "go away.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\n",
        "and wave him away like that.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\n",
        "the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\n",
        "in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\n",
        "road.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\n",
        "interesting one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\n",
        "be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On\n",
        "the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took\n",
        "me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we\n",
        "approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\n",
        "of a large animal moving about.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\n",
        "planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\n",
        "figure huddled up in the darkness.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I\n",
        "had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\n",
        "old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\n",
        "feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\n",
        "keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\n",
        "trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you\n",
        "ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s\n",
        "as much as your life is worth.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\n",
        "out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a\n",
        "beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\n",
        "silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the\n",
        "peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\n",
        "moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\n",
        "moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\n",
        "tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\n",
        "bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\n",
        "upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\n",
        "which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\n",
        "know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\n",
        "the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I\n",
        "began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\n",
        "rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in\n",
        "the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I\n",
        "had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\n",
        "away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\n",
        "It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\n",
        "took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key\n",
        "fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one\n",
        "thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It\n",
        "was my coil of hair.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\n",
        "the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\n",
        "itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With\n",
        "trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\n",
        "from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I\n",
        "assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\n",
        "as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\n",
        "the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\n",
        "Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\n",
        "drawer which they had locked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\n",
        "soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\n",
        "one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\n",
        "which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\n",
        "this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\n",
        "ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\n",
        "his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\n",
        "different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\n",
        "cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\n",
        "stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\n",
        "past me without a word or a look.\n",
        "\n",
        "“This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\n",
        "grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\n",
        "see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\n",
        "row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\n",
        "up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\n",
        "glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\n",
        "merry and jovial as ever.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\n",
        "word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem\n",
        "to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\n",
        "shutters up.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\n",
        "remark.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\n",
        "up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\n",
        "Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\n",
        "in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\n",
        "me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\n",
        "something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\n",
        "on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\n",
        "share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good\n",
        "might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s\n",
        "instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.\n",
        "At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\n",
        "chance to pass the forbidden door.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\n",
        "besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\n",
        "these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\n",
        "bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\n",
        "yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\n",
        "the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\n",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\n",
        "them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently\n",
        "in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\n",
        "which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\n",
        "were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\n",
        "They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\n",
        "in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\n",
        "light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\n",
        "across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\n",
        "iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\n",
        "the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the\n",
        "key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\n",
        "shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\n",
        "beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\n",
        "skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\n",
        "gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\n",
        "suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\n",
        "backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\n",
        "out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\n",
        "sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\n",
        "turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\n",
        "clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\n",
        "the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\n",
        "outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be\n",
        "when I saw the door open.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\n",
        "caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my\n",
        "dear young lady?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\n",
        "keenly on my guard against him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it\n",
        "is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\n",
        "out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He\n",
        "was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘I am sure if I had known—’\n",
        "\n",
        "“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\n",
        "threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\n",
        "rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you\n",
        "to the mastiff.’\n",
        "\n",
        "“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\n",
        "must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\n",
        "found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\n",
        "Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\n",
        "frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\n",
        "even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\n",
        "you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\n",
        "but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\n",
        "made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\n",
        "to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\n",
        "returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\n",
        "as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\n",
        "that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\n",
        "evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\n",
        "any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\n",
        "free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\n",
        "the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\n",
        "into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\n",
        "for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\n",
        "the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\n",
        "all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\n",
        "tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\n",
        "friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\n",
        "pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\n",
        "with him.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\n",
        "and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\n",
        "more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\n",
        "exceptional woman.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will try. What is it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.\n",
        "The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\n",
        "incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\n",
        "you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\n",
        "key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will do it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\n",
        "there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\n",
        "personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\n",
        "That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\n",
        "the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\n",
        "have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\n",
        "height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\n",
        "very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\n",
        "course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\n",
        "upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\n",
        "hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress\n",
        "and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\n",
        "saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\n",
        "perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\n",
        "is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\n",
        "with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\n",
        "is the disposition of the child.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\n",
        "to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see\n",
        "that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\n",
        "real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\n",
        "This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s\n",
        "sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\n",
        "suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\n",
        "their power.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A\n",
        "thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit\n",
        "it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\n",
        "creature.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\n",

        "and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\n",
        "Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\n",
        "group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\n",
        "the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\n",
        "had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. “That is Mrs.\n",
        "Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on the\n",
        "kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\n",
        "Rucastle’s.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes with enthusiasm. “Now lead\n",
        "the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\n",
        "\n",
        "We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\n",
        "and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\n",
        "described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\n",
        "tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\n",
        "from within, and at the silence Holmes’ face clouded over.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,\n",
        "that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\n",
        "it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\n",
        "Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\n",
        "save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The\n",
        "skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has\n",
        "guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions and has carried his victim off.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But how?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung\n",
        "himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried, “here’s the end of a\n",
        "long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there\n",
        "when the Rucastles went away.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\n",
        "dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\n",
        "whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\n",
        "as well for you to have your pistol ready.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\n",
        "door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\n",
        "hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\n",
        "him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\n",
        "\n",
        "The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and\n",
        "thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve\n",
        "you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\n",
        "\n",
        "“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have my revolver,” said I.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\n",
        "stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\n",
        "baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\n",
        "sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\n",
        "face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\n",
        "\n",
        "“My God!” he cried. “Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for\n",
        "two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\n",
        "hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\n",
        "buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\n",
        "ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\n",
        "keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\n",
        "much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\n",
        "mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\n",
        "having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\n",
        "did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\n",
        "when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\n",
        "to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\n",
        "planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller\n",
        "knows more about this matter than anyone else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\n",
        "on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done so\n",
        "before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s\n",
        "police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one\n",
        "that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\n",
        "\n",
        "“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that her\n",
        "father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\n",
        "but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\n",
        "at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\n",
        "her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\n",
        "never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s\n",
        "hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\n",
        "husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\n",
        "him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\n",
        "to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\n",
        "money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\n",
        "brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better\n",
        "at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\n",
        "that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\n",
        "true as man could be.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to tell\n",
        "us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\n",
        "remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\n",
        "imprisonment?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Yes, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\n",
        "disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“That was it, sir.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\n",
        "blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\n",
        "metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\n",
        "same as his.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\n",
        "Toller serenely.\n",
        "\n",
        "“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\n",
        "drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\n",
        "had gone out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you\n",
        "have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\n",
        "the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\n",
        "best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\n",
        "_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”\n",
        "\n",
        "And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\n",
        "beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\n",
        "broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\n",
        "They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\n",
        "Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.\n",
        "Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\n",
        "Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\n",
        "government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\n",
        "Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\n",
        "further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\n",
