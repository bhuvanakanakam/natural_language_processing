Hi, I am Bhuvana Kanakam. This folder is part of the natural language processing repository, elective course of my Semester 6. This is a team projects which I am working with 4 others. { Ramya, Pramod, Vivek, Saketh }.

#### Problem Statement
##### Regional Language Toxic Comment Classification. 
This project aims to develop a model for classifying comments as toxic or non-toxic across multiple Indian languages.

#### Approach 

We have few basic thoughts on how to go ahead with our project, Right Now that contains the following few steps.
- Train a model to identify toxic comments in Hindi (Hi), Tamil (Ta), Telugu (Te), Malayalam (Ml), and Kannada (Kn) languages.
- Utilize the MACD dataset (https://github.com/topics/macd-indicator) to train and evaluate the model.
- Potentially explore multilingual pre-trained language models (e.g., MuBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) for improved performance.
- Develop a basic web application to demonstrate the model's functionality.

the dataset is acquired from - https://github.com/ShareChatAI/MACD/tree/main/dataset. The paper published on this data set states that it is gathered from - ShareChat, which supports over 15 Indic languages. MACD comprises of 150K textual comments posted on 92881 posts by 70453 users with 74K abusive and 77K non-abusive comments (49% abuse ratio) from five Indic languages - Hindi (Hi), Tamil (Ta), Telugu (Te), Malayalam (Ml) and Kannada (Kn).
